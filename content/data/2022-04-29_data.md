summary: "Complete dataset from a mobile EEG study examining how locomotion affects visual sensory processing. Includes raw EEG data in EEGLAB format, preprocessed ERP and ERSP matrices, behavioral data (reaction times, accuracy), subjective workload ratings, D-Flow treadmill applications, and MATLAB analysis scripts. The study investigated visual processing capabilities under varying locomotor loads to understand cognitive-motor interactions in real-world environments."

## Overview

This dataset contains all data and analysis materials from the study **"Did you even see that? Visual sensory processing of single stimuli under different locomotor loads"**. The research investigates how different levels of locomotor activity affect visual sensory processing using mobile EEG recordings. The study employed a dual-task paradigm where participants performed visual detection tasks while standing or walking on a treadmill with or without lateral perturbations.

The dataset provides comprehensive neurophysiological and behavioral data suitable for research on cognitive-motor interference, mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI), and real-world neuroscience applications.
