description: "This study demonstrates the use of eye-blink-evoked EEG activity to assess operator cognitive states in a realistic workplace simulation. Fourteen participants operated or observed a power plant steam engine while their neural activity was recorded, revealing systematic differences in brain responses between active and passive work conditions." 
summary: "Using eye-blink-evoked EEG analysis in a power plant operator simulation, this study successfully differentiated between active operation and passive observation states in 14 participants. The active condition showed increased posterior N1 and P3 amplitudes, enhanced frontal theta power, suppressed parietal alpha power, and stronger functional connectivity across multiple brain regions. These findings demonstrate that natural eye-blink events can serve as effective markers for assessing cognitive demands and operator states in realistic work environments without requiring artificial stimuli."

##### Abstract

Evaluating and understanding the cognitive demands of natural activities has been difficult using neurocognitive approaches like mobile EEG. While task-unrelated stimuli are commonly added to a workplace simulation to estimate event-related cognitive processes, using eyeblink activity poses an alternative as it is inherent to human behavior. This study aimed to investigate the eye blink event-related EEG activity of fourteen subjects while working in a power-plant operator simulation - actively operating (active condition) or observing (passive condition) a real-world steam engine. The changes in event-related potentials, event-related spectral perturbations, and functional connectivity under both conditions were analyzed. Our results indicated several cognitive changes in relation to task manipulation. Posterior N1 and P3 amplitudes revealed alterations associated with task complexity, with increased N1 and P3 amplitudes for the active condition, indicating greater cognitive effort than the passive condition. Increased frontal theta power and suppressed parietal alpha power were observed during the active condition reflecting high cognitive engagement. Additionally, higher theta connectivity was seen in fronto-parieto-centro-temporo-occipital regions as task demands increased, showing increased communication between brain regions. All of these results suggest using eye blink-related EEG activity to acquire a comprehensive understanding of neuro-cognitive processing while working in realistic environments.
