description: "This study introduces a novel approach using naturally occurring eye-blinks as discrete events to segment EEG activity for assessing cognitive demands during walking. The research demonstrates that blink-evoked EEG potentials can effectively measure visual processing loads across different movement complexities without requiring artificial stimuli." 
summary: "Using eye-blink-evoked EEG analysis on data from 36 participants, this study successfully demonstrated that natural blinks can serve as time-discrete markers for cognitive workload assessment during real-world walking tasks. The findings revealed systematic changes in visual processing components (N1, N2, P3) and oscillatory activity (theta, alpha) with increasing movement complexity from standing to walking to obstacle navigation. This approach provides a robust method for evaluating cognitive demands in natural work environments without artificial task manipulations."

##### Abstract

Blinking is a natural user-induced response which paces visual information processing. This study investigates whether blinks are viable for segmenting continuous electroencephalography (EEG) activity, for inferring cognitive demands in ecologically valid work environments. We report the blink-related EEG measures of participants who performed auditory tasks either standing, walking on grass, or whilst completing an obstacle course. Blink-related EEG activity discriminated between different levels of cognitive demand during walking. Both behavioral parameters (e.g., blink duration or head motion) and blink-related EEG activity varied with walking conditions. Larger occipital N1 was observed during walking, relative to standing and traversing an obstacle course, which reflects differences in bottom-up visual perception. In contrast, the amplitudes of top-down components (N2, P3) significantly decreased with increasing walking demands, which reflected narrowing attention. This is consistent with blink-related EEG, specifically in Theta and Alpha power that, respectively, increased and decreased with increasing demands of the walking task. This work presents a novel and robust analytical approach to evaluate the cognitive demands experienced in natural work settings, which precludes the use of artificial task manipulations for data segmentation.
