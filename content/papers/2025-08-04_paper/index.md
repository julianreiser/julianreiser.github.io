description: "This paper investigates how people process audiovisual information while walking and moving, examining the interaction between cognitive tasks and physical movement. The study uses virtual reality, behavioral measures, and EEG data to understand attention demands when using wearable devices during locomotion. Published in Psychophysiology, 2025." 
summary: "Using VR experiments with 22 participants, this study found that walking interferes with cognitive task performance, but the type of information presentation (audio vs. visual) matters significantly. While auditory cues led to faster responses under simple conditions, visual information was more resilient when both cognitive and movement demands were high. The research suggests that wearable device interfaces should be designed differently depending on the complexity of tasks users need to perform while moving."

##### Abstract

Contemporary work environments require humans to process audiovisual information displays during active locomotion. The attentional demands associated with using devices such as in-ear headphones and head-mounted displays may be significantly influenced by varying locomotor demands, yet this relationship remains poorly understood. This study investigates the interplay of information presentation modality, movement state, and cognitive task difficulty. In a virtual reality laboratory, 22 participants performed a cued task-switch paradigm with three cognitive task difficulty levels while standing, walking, or walking with perturbations on a treadmill. We used a questionnaire, behavioral, and mobile EEG data to investigate cognitive-motor interference. We find that locomotion interfered with cognitive task performance, and that the presentation modality of task-switch notification modified the nature of this interference. While auditory cue presentation resulted in faster responses under low cognitive load conditions, visual information presentation was less impaired by higher cognitive and locomotor demands. A detailed analysis of the EEG response to cues addressed these differences in terms of multi-modal attentional mechanisms. Hence, information presentation on wearable devices should be tailored to the specific task demands, particularly for cognitively demanding information in mobile work settings.
