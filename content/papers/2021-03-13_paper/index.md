description: "A comprehensive review demonstrating the potential of mobile EEG systems for neuroergonomic applications in real-world work environments. This paper systematically addresses technical state-of-the-art, measurement approaches, cognitive concepts, and practical applications for assessing mental states and cognitive processing during naturalistic work activities."
summary: "This review paper establishes mobile EEG as a valuable tool for neuroergonomics, enabling objective assessment of mental states and cognitive processes in real work environments without disrupting natural workflows. The authors present current mobile EEG systems, discuss frequency-domain and time-domain measures, introduce innovative approaches like blink-evoked potentials for naturalistic settings, and outline practical applications for workplace safety and performance optimization. Key findings demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably measure mental fatigue, cognitive workload, attention allocation, and task engagement across diverse work scenarios from driving to manual assembly."

##### Abstract

Objective: We demonstrate and discuss the use of mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) for neuroergonomics. Both technical state of the art as well as measures and cognitive concepts are systematically addressed.

Background: Modern work is increasingly characterized by information processing. Therefore, the examination of mental states, mental load, or cognitive processing during work is becoming increasingly important for ergonomics.

Results: Mobile EEG allows to measure mental states and processes under real live conditions. It can be used for various research questions in cognitive neuroergonomics. Besides measures in the frequency domain that have a long tradition in the investigation of mental fatigue, task load, and task engagement, new approaches—like blink-evoked potentials—render event-related analyses of the EEG possible also during unrestricted behavior.

Conclusion: Mobile EEG has become a valuable tool for evaluating mental states and mental processes on a highly objective level during work. The main advantage of this technique is that working environments don't have to be changed while systematically measuring brain functions at work. Moreover, the workflow is unaffected by such neuroergonomic approaches.
